# Infant8
A new Infant approach searches for the global minimum chemical structures (complexes, large biomolecular systems) along vibrational modes calculating the energies of intramolecular (MM3 force field) and intermolecular (Model of Effective Radii of Atoms (MERA)) interactions with the possibility of fixing structural fragments
